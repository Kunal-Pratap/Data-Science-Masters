    "The purpose of forward propagation in a neural network is to process input data through the network's layers of interconnected neurons, applying weighted sums and activation functions at each layer. This process allows the network to make predictions or classifications based on the input data. During forward propagation, information flows from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer, with each layer transforming the input in a way that captures relevant features and patterns. The output generated by the network is then compared to the actual target values, and the resulting error is used to optimize the network's parameters during the training process.\n",

Vanishing gradients occur when gradients become extremely small, leading to slow or stalled learning, while exploding gradients involve excessively large gradients causing oscillations or divergence. These issues are often mitigated by using appropriate activation functions, weight initialization methods, and techniques like gradient clipping. Additionally, selecting suitable optimization algorithms, adjusting learning rates, and employing batch normalization can help stabilize training and address challenges associated with backward propagation in neural networks. Regularization methods like dropout may also be applied to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization performance.\n",
