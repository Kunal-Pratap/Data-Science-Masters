    "In the context of artificial neural networks, an activation function is a mathematical operation applied to the weighted sum of input values to determine the output of a neuron. It introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns and relationships in data. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU). The choice of activation function influences the network's ability to model and approximate different types of functions, impacting its performance in tasks such as classification or regression.\n",

    "Common types of activation functions used in neural networks include the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU). The sigmoid function squashes input values to a range between 0 and 1, while tanh squashes them to a range between -1 and 1. ReLU, on the other hand, returns the input for positive values and zero for negative values, introducing non-linearity. These functions enable neural networks to model complex relationships and make them suitable for various tasks such as classification, regression, and feature extraction. Choosing the appropriate activation function depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the neural network.\n",

Unlike ReLU, which sets negative values to zero, leaky ReLU retains a small linear component, typically a small fraction like 0.01 times the input value. This small slope prevents neurons from becoming completely inactive for negative inputs, addressing the vanishing gradient problem associated with traditional ReLU. Leaky ReLU helps maintain non-linearity and facilitates the flow of gradients during backpropagation, making it a useful alternative in deep neural networks to enhance learning and mitigate issues with dead neurons.\n",
