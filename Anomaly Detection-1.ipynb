    "Anomaly detection is a technique used in machine learning to identify instances that deviate significantly from the norm or expected behavior within a dataset. The purpose of anomaly detection is to pinpoint observations, data points, or events that are rare, unusual, or potentially indicative of errors, outliers, or anomalies. This technique is valuable in various fields, including cybersecurity, fraud detection, fault monitoring, and quality control, where the identification of abnormal patterns is crucial for maintaining system integrity and security.\n",

    "Key challenges in anomaly detection include dealing with imbalanced datasets, where normal instances significantly outnumber anomalies, making it harder for models to learn rare patterns. Another challenge is defining a suitable threshold for distinguishing anomalies, as setting it too high may lead to false negatives, while setting it too low may result in false positives. Additionally, anomalies may evolve over time, requiring models to adapt. Anomalies can also be context-dependent, making it challenging to generalize across diverse datasets and applications. Ensuring robustness to noise and handling high-dimensional data are additional challenges in effective anomaly detection.\n",
