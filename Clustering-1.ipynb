    "Clustering algorithms can be broadly categorized into partitioning methods (e.g., K-means), hierarchical methods (e.g., Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering), density-based methods (e.g., DBSCAN), and model-based methods (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models). They differ in their approach to forming clusters, handling shapes and densities, and making assumptions about the underlying structure of the data. Partitioning methods assign data points to distinct clusters, hierarchical methods create a tree-like structure, density-based methods identify dense regions, and model-based methods assume a probabilistic model for cluster assignment. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the nature of the data and the desired outcomes.\n",

    "K-means clustering is a partitioning algorithm that divides a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (clusters). It works by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centroid and then updating the centroids based on the mean of the assigned points. This process repeats until convergence, minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares. K-means is sensitive to the initial placement of centroids and may converge to local optima, making it advisable to run the algorithm multiple times with different initializations.\n",

The elbow method involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters and choosing the \"elbow\" point where the rate of decrease slows. The silhouette score measures how well-separated clusters are, with higher scores indicating better-defined clusters. The Davies-Bouldin index assesses cluster compactness and separation. Selecting the number of clusters where these metrics suggest optimal partitioning is a common approach."
